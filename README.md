# mjl-simulations on Piezoelectric Energy harvesting(PEH) Tires

## Aim of repository-
To provide simulation results using theoritical aspects of tire(presusure, weight, dimensions etc), car(type, weight, speed, etc) and calculate energy/power to further match it with experimental results.

Simulations provide feature engineering of the project which helps in determining the power output and improvize the experimental set-up in each proceeding step. It can further help in reverse engineering and power optimization.
